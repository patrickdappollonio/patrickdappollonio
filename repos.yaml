- name: http-server
  description: |
    A small, but batteries-included static HTTP server. Includes a file explorer and support for Github-flavoured Markdown rendering. It's fully air-grapped, meaning it won't make any request to any third-party site (unless your code does so), so it plays well with highly-regulated environments. Useful for static pages like documentation.

    Have you ever wanted to split YAML manifests separated by "---" into individual files? This tool does that for you, and uses a template-style approach to generate filenames by tapping into typical Kubernetes YAML structure.

    I've always thought the developer experience of cloning a repo is a bit cumbersome: you have to find a path where you want to store the repo, then ensure you copied the right URL or Git reference, then run `git clone`. This tool simplifies that process by allowing you to clone a repo by just saying `gc <user>/<repo>`.

    My own attempt at a template tool that can be used in CI and automation environments. Provide a Go template either from a file or directly as an argument, load environment variables from the environment or from a file, then render the template! It includes a "strict" mode that prevents you from rendering a template if an environment variable that the template depends on is missing.

    After seeing multiple bash attempts, I decided to write my own as well. This is a tiny application that can query a TCP endpoint (like a website or database) and hold until the endpoint is reachable or a timeout happens. Super useful to use in CI/CD pipelines or `initContainers` in Kubernetes.

    I'm always doing `kubectl get X` and while I know some `awk`, I'm not an expert. This tool can parse table-like outputs found in `kubectl` and other CLI tools and use an expression engine to query and filter the output, while at the same time reformatting whitespaces and headers to make it more readable.
- name: nginx-vs-caddy-benchmark
  description: |
    Born off a Twitter argument where someone claimed Caddy was faster than Nginx, I decided to write a small environment to test that claim. This repo holds `docker-compose` files to spin up environments and steps to try them out. The idea is to get a comparison as close to apples-to-apples as possible between Caddy and Nginx.
- name: cloudflare-cache-purger
  description: |
    Looking at CI as well, whenever I deploy [my own site](https://www.patrickdap.com) I need to also purge the aggressive Cloudflare cache I have in front of it. This tool allows you to purge the cache by just providing a token and the zone ID. It's also offered as a container, so you can use it in your CI/CD pipelines.
- name: find-project
  description: |
    I like Go's `$GOPATH` and the brainless process it becomes maintaining folders with projects in your machine where `github.com/foo/bar` becomes `~/go/src/github.com/foo/bar`. Switching between projects though becomes a pain. `find-project` is a small tool that allows you to provide a project name and it will find the project in your `$GOPATH` by choosing whatever is closest to the root first.
- name: kubernetes-guestbook
  description: The Kubernetes community wrote a Guestbook in PHP that requires a Redis backend with quite a few requirements to run. I decided to write a version of it in Go that uses several backend options instead (as of now, basic Redis and SQL Server). Available both as a container and a Helm chart.
